## todo:

1) Unit tests - more
2) Better typing for decorators
4) Class decorators check as separated util.

?) Test utils and separated scoping for testing?
?) Proxy manager instances references to prevent ref saving of old ones? Better memory cleanup + like synthetic react events work.
?) IE 11 support check + getOwnPropertySymbols support for IE

- Think about actions/state separation.
- Better dev assistance with logs and warnings for development bundle.
- Better docs with change log after v3
