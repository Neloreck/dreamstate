## todo:

1) Unit tests - more
2) Better typing for decorators
3) Signal optional params for usage.
4) Class decorators check as separated util.
5) Bind - shared decorator util usage?

?) Test utils and separated scoping for testing?
?) Proxy manager instances references to prevent ref saving of old ones? Better memory cleanup + like synthetic react events work.
?) ES and UMD bundles checking and testing?
?) Work with tree shaking for not used imports
?) IE 11 support check + getOwnPropertySymbols support for IE

- Think about actions/state separation.
- Better dev assistance with logs and warnings for development bundle.
- Better docs with change log after v3
