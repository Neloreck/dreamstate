## todo:

1) Unit tests - more
2) Better typing for decorators
3) Signals as packed objects
4) Query API
5) Signal optional params for usage.

?) Proxy manager instances references to prevent ref saving of old ones? Better memory cleanup + like synthetic react events work.
?) ES and UMD bundles?

- Think about actions/state separation.
- Better dev assistance with logs and warnings for development bundle.
- Better docs with change log after some complete state.
