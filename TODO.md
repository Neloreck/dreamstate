## future:

- ContextWorker -> ContextService
- Multiple actions for queryData method
- createAsync as loadable copy with stored promise or extended createLoadable

- Think about actions/state separation. [HoCs do not allow to do so]
- Better dev assistance with logs and warnings for development bundle.
- Async code execution utils like takeLatest/takeLeading etc?

?) Scoping and separated registry?
