## todo:

1) Unit tests - 100% coverage
2) Think about inheritance and how to implement it/warn about it without performance degradation.
3) Think about query api name
4) Interceptor classes for 'queries' and signals

N) Better typing for decorators --> Is it possible now?

?) Test utils and separated scoping for testing?
?) Proxy manager instances references to prevent ref saving of old ones? Better memory cleanup + like synthetic react events work.
?) IE 11 support check + getOwnPropertySymbols support for IE

- Think about actions/state separation.
- Better dev assistance with logs and warnings for development bundle.
- Better docs with change log after v3 + docs
