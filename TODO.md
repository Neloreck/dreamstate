## future:

- createAsync as loadable copy with stored promise or extended createLoadable
- test queries with cases when declared 2 or more handlers
- test useContextWithMemo properly
- fixtures separation and review - removed odd items
- more exotic cases
- macros alias
- alias after type bundling fixes?
- multiple tsconfig usage review

- Docs update
- Simple examples of library usage

- Think about actions/state separation. [HoCs do not allow to do so]
- Better dev assistance with logs and warnings for development bundle.
- Async code execution utils like takeLatest/takeLeading etc?

?) Scoping and separated registry?
