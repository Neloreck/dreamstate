## todo:

1) Think about query api name
2) ContextInterceptor classes for 'queries' and signals
3) Validation tests for createObserver

N) Better typing for decorators --> Is it possible now?

?) Test utils and separated scoping for testing?
?) Proxy manager instances references to prevent ref saving of old ones? Better memory cleanup + like synthetic react events work.
?) IE 11 support check + getOwnPropertySymbols support for IE

- Think about actions/state separation.
- Better dev assistance with logs and warnings for development bundle.
- Better docs with change log after v3 + docs
