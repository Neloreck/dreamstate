## todo:

1) Do we need array for onSignal?
2) More async code? (signals, register/unregister etc)
3) Integration tests with exotic cases (exceptions on lifecycle, signals and queries on lifecycle)
4) Think about query api name.

?) Scoping for signaling and query?

- Think about actions/state separation.
- Better dev assistance with logs and warnings for development bundle.
- Async code execution like takeLatest/takeLeading etc?
