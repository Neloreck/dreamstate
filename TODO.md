## future:

- createAsync as loadable copy with stored promise or extended createLoadable
- test queries with cases when declared 2 or more handlers
- test useContextWithMemo properly
- more exotic cases

- Docs update
- Simple examples of library usage

- Think about actions/state separation. [HoCs do not allow to do so]
- Better dev assistance with logs and warnings for development bundle.
- Async code execution utils like takeLatest/takeLeading etc?

?) Scoping and separated registry?
